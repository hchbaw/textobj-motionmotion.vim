INTRODUCTION				 *textobj-motionmotion-introduction*

*textobj-motionmotion* is a Vim plugin to provide text objets to select a
piece of text bounded by the cursor positions of the following 2 motions.

For example, an asterisk (*) is used to denote the cursor position:
>
  ./runtime/doc/mo*tion.txt
<
"vim3bt." will select 'doc/motion' as follows:
(here (^) indicates the selected texts)
>
  ./runtime/doc/motion.txt
            ^^^^^^^^^^
<
Roughly speaking, this plugin makes an operator such that ["^x]c{motion} to
be able to respond ["x]cim{motion}{motion} (*im* is the default key mapping).
Hence the name "motionmotion" has been derived from.

Note that this plugin is far from complete. Please use *[range]* or
*Visual-mode* in the real world!

Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later
- |textobj-user| 0.3.8 or later

USAGE					*textobj-motionmotion-usage*

Note on text-objects.

Builtin text-objects are supported. Note that if text-objects used as
{motion}s, the selected object's start or end position will be considered as
cursor positions.
If used as the first motion, the start of the object position will be taken.
If used as the second motion, the end of the object position will be taken.

For example, an asterisk (*) is used to denote the cursor position and (^)
indicates the selected texts:
>
  te*xt_objects
<
"vimiwf_" will select:
>
  text_objects
  ^^^^^
<
"vimf_iw" will select:
>
  text_objects
      ^^^^^^^^

			The second motion will be executed at the position as
			the result of the first motion execution.

<Plug>(textobj-motionmotion-i)		*<Plug>(textobj-motionmotion-i)*
			Like |<Plug>(textobj-motionmotion-a)|, but the second

CUSTOMIZING				*textobj-motionmotion-customizing*

This plugin will define the following key mappings in Visual mode and
Operator-pending mode automatically.  If you don't want these key mappings,
define |g:textobj_motionmotion_no_default_key_mappings| before this plugin is
loaded (e.g. in your |vimrc|).  You can also use
|:TextobjMotionmotionDefaultKeyMappings| to redefine these key mappings. This
command doesn't override existing {lhs}s unless [!] is given.

	{lhs}	{rhs}
	-----	------------------------------~
	am	<Plug>(textobj-motionmotion-a)
	im	<Plug>(textobj-motionmotion-i)
